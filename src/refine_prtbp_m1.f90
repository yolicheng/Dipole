!  This two routines  refine_curve_poinc_m1 + fix_index, are used to avoid 
!  the indetermination in phase shift, fix c1_ind or s1_ind based on the strategy 
!  in Josep-Maria's thesis

!  since in this way we will have 1 less unknows than the equations, so we discard this approach at the moment.

! This routine is to refine the invariant curve, 
! with the initial guess of the coefficients computed by gr_four   
 

!**NOTE: Alex's note about the Poincare map method 
!  The tori we are looking for are embedded in 2â€“parametric families, which can be paramtrized by 2 parameters among h, rho   
!  The curve on the torus is fixed by thePoincare section, so we do not have curve indetermination

!  Therefore, in order to compute a torus, we  need to 
!    1. set a coordinate of C1 (S1) equal to zero and eliminate it, in order to get rid of the phase shift indetermination. 
!       Here we take C1_ind(S1_ind), ind is specified by routine  'fix_index', according to the strategy in Josep-Maria's thesis

!    2. eliminate two unknonws h and rho, in order to fix a particular curve,
!       by looking at the Poincare map representation of the torus, we can see we have bunch of 
!       invariant curve, which can be specified by the rotation number rho 
!       so, we eliminate h and rho       

!  So we end up with a   nr ( n*nf2p1 ) - by -  nc (= n*nf2p1 - 1) system of linear equations, 

!  with unique solution but which has more equations than uknowns. 
!  This is not a problem, as long as we use the general rutine we have described, specifying the kernel dimension to be zero

! TODO: why the kernel dimension is zero? 

!   we have to 
!   The linear equations to be solved:
!                  dg *  dX = - ferr
! 
!  1.  the whole diffrential dg: D F/ d A (C_0, C's, S's) 
!  2.  the error: ferr,  to be refined by Newton method 

!  -- the Linear equation F to slove for Newton Method : 
!     F =  \varphi(xi_i + rho) - P (xi_i) = 0 ],  i = 1,..., Nf    ! the invariance condition

!-- Strategy to eliminate unknowns to avoid indeterminations

!   - 2. To avoid the indetermination in phase shift, mostly for continuation cosideration
!       2.1. Eliminate C1_J or C1_J, where J is chosen in order to have || (C1_J, S1_J) ||_2  =  max_{i=1,..., ndim} || (C1_i, S1_i) ||_2
!            The reason for this choice is heuristic and tries to prevent asking conditions on harmonics of low amplitudes.

!       2.2  Between C1_J and S1_J, we select the coordinate for which min(|C1_J|, |S1_J| ) is achieved. This avoids the situation:
!            assume before the correction, C1_J=0 and |S1_J| = alpha. If we eliminate S1_J, we are forcing  
!            || (C1_J, S1_J) ||_2 > alpha and therefore we will not be able to continue if || (C1_J, S1_J) ||_2 > decreases
!            along the family. If |C1_J| is different from zero but small, we will be able to continue but the continuation step
!            will be artificially reduced.  

!** Another strategy is: Set C(k)_J = 0 as long as S(k)_J remains different from zero, that is  ( C(k)_J, S(k)_J) \= 0 
!   Usually , we take k=1 (the x component) and J has been chosen in order to maximize || ( C(k)_J, S(k)_J) ||_2. 

!   Comment: the first strategy is better, because it doesn't depend on a Fourier coefficients being different from zero 
!   and C1_1 = C1_x = 0, we need to introduce 2 variables as the indice of unknowns to fix the value
